# Weapons update: throwing, boomerang, keys, loot slide

>> All logic is in AI/. Outside it, files only got `partial` or a one-line hook (search "AIHooks.").
>> [TWEAK] = a setting designers can change.  [SETUP] = assign once or it won't work.

[SETUP]  Database/Resources/PrefabDatabase > fist = Database/Weapons/Fist  (keep it in a Resources folder)
[TWEAK]  Experimental > Weapons: throwing, boomerangReturns, yoink, locks  (untick = feature off)


Throw      hold Q / pad X + weapon button. Lands as loot; the hand goes back to Fist (Unequip).
[TWEAK]    Weapon > Throw Settings (foldout): damage, initSpeed, knockback, canThrow, isBounce, and
             deceleration  0 = flies until a wall
             size          radius it hits with
             maxHits       0 = no limit
             bounciness    speed kept per bounce
             spinSpeed     0 = flies point first (a boomerang spins with this too)
             spriteAngle   which way the art points (0 = right)

Boomerang  a weapon of type Boomerang: its attack comes back through walls. The hand waits until it's back.
[TWEAK]    Weapon > boomerangDeceleration  slow-down going out

Keys       >> a weapon with a keyId is a key. A Door / Chest / Lock with a keyId is locked.
           The key with the same keyId opens it, swung or thrown.
[TWEAK]    keyId on the weapon and on the Door / Chest;  consumeKey = key is used up (default off)

Loot       dropped loot slides and bounces (placed loot stays put; still falls in Holes).
[TWEAK]    in code: LootYoink.speed / deceleration / bounciness (AI/Yoink.cs)

PlayOnce   AI/PlayOnce.cs: play an animation once, then hide / destroy. Use it anywhere.
           Door opens with it (plays once, then gone); the heal effect lasts as long as its animation.
